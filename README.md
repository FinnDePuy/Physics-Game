A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Asset sources:
All assets that were used were simply from the windows + . menu of windows which gives access to the emoji menu. Because HTML and windows use different emojis there may be some broken emojis. However my last 10 tests all cameout with functional emojis, please let me know if anything breaks again.

New Mechanics:

    Crafting: I made a system which is pretty basic, but very crucial to the function of the game. When you have specific crafting components in your inventory it will automatically create a new item on the ground.

    Shell Counting: I made a mechanic where every island contains shells and every shell you find can be collected. And every time that you go to an old island a new shell appears almost like a tracker of how many times you've traveled. I decided to also only have the shells have an animation to separate the optional counter item with the required progression items.
