Asset sources:
All assets except for one were created using piskelapp which is an online pixel art creation software https://www.piskelapp.com/
the player asset was created in inkscape

New Mechanics:
I chose to incorperate wall jumping, dashing, and a timer mechanic

Continuous and discrete inputs from the player:
Continuous inputs: A,D,E,Q which can be held down to move in different directions based on input.
Discrete inputs: W, S which are the jump and fall buttons

Goal can only be achieved indirectly:
The game can only be completed by the player controlling their character to the end of the three levels

3+ physics gameplay scenes & three other scenes:
I have three levels all with a unique layout. And a summary page after each level describing what your point totals are looking like. There is also an introduction page with instructions. And an outro page with total scores.
